# ðŸ”« Hoom (WIP)
It is actually NOT a doom-like at the moment, it will be (hopefully). This is
more like a test project where i see what i can do with raylib, there is
nothing really fancy (yet).

## ðŸ”¨ Building
GHC 9.8.4 is **needed**

#### `nix`:
```bash
$ nix build .#
```

#### `cabal`:
```bash
$ cabal build
```

#### `stack`:
```bash
$ stack build
```
